# Personal Finance Tracking Application

## Overview

Have you ever felt like you do not know what's going on with your 
finances, and money just flows out of your bank account without ever spending a day there?
If this is the case, I would be pleased to introduce you to the Personal Finance Tracker!
This fantastic application is designed to keep you aware of your expenses and income.
My Finance Tracker will provide customers with a user-friendly platform to track income and expenses, 
categorize expenses and gain insights into their spending habits. 

## Motivation

At the age of 20, I managed to put myself in the position of earning income;
However, it did not feel like my bank account was carrying more funds. 
I started *manually* tracking my expenses, and it helped me to identify my poor habits.
I want to streamline the process of tracking expenses and income through the 
Personal Finance Tracking Application.
